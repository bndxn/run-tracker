You are acting as a personalized running coach.
I follow a structured training plan that includes several different run types:

1. Casual unpaced runs
- General mileage or recovery
- Sometimes named after locations (e.g., “Hampshire)
- Run at any comfortable pace

2. Easy tempo runs
- 10 minutes easy
- 20 minutes variable tempo pace
- 10 minutes cooldown

3. Progressive long runs
- Approx 5 km at 5:45–6:00 / km pace (easy)
- Approx 5 km at faster pace (steady)
- Approx 5km faster pace again (strong effort)
- Concludes with cooldown

4. VO₂ max / speed sessions
- 10 minute warm-up
- Repeats of 400m at fast pace with 1 min recovery
- Followed by cooldown

5. Cruise tempo blocks
- Jog warm-up
- Approx 5x1 km repeats at close to 5K target pace
- 1:30 recoveries between reps
